        <h3>How did Egofear come to existence?</h3>
        <p>
            Egofear is just a collective of people who are my friends. I wanted to make a group. Thats literally it, nothing fancy or a long deep reasoning to make it. I just wanted a "stylish" group lol.
        </p>

        <h3>Who developed it?</h3>
        <p>Asthma made the entire website, it is a simple website. Nothing complex or anything of the sort. They also mess around with other projects besides web development, such as messing around with APIs and making really shit game cheats.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>How do you make a cheat?</h3>
        <p>
            Genuinely, learn a language. May that be C/C++ or C#, basically whatever you prefer more. (Experiment with it.) I recommend following tutorials for the first part of the journey. I recommend GuidedHacking overall. Then experiment with Source Games. In order to produce a full cheat you'll need both programming knowledge and reverse engineering knowledge. If you're end goal is to make a cheat for a game protected by an Anti-Cheat (specifically kernel level) you have a long way to go.

        <h3>What's your view on most VRChat clients?</h3>
        <p>
            Most client modifications on VRChat nowadays apparently use a NVIDIA sign leak back from 2023. So, majority of them, if it is true, dont really have a hope in the world to keep it from getting detected. (This was referred to as the WinSock method I believe.) Although, there were some talented developers from that scene. So, I give where credit is due.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why does VRChat still have "client users".</h3>
        <p>
            VRChat still has client users because they really aren't experienced within combatting cheats / exploits. From what I have seen personally, their whole defense is just piggy-backing on EAC. Although, they still do claim all their bans are "manual", when thats clearly bullshit. For example, seemingly automated unclear reasoning for bans.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ultimate reason why Easy Anti-Cheat was implemented was probably because of investors influencing the decision. Eventhough, they literally killed tons of wholesome "quality of life" modifications to the game that made it perform well.
