cody what ur essentially asking for due to the style of the profile deleting the elements and re adding them on hovering will take a bit of performance issues
making display as hidden then changing it on hover makes them disappear visually but you can still see the links url prompt on the bottom left
and since the box is responsive to changes in size depending on whats inside the container it makes it appear larger than it should
so basically what im telling you is your idea is unrealistic unless you want to visually piss me off
plus the drop down is shit for socials
ill add it for other things such as showing a handle for the users e.g. "@user"
if you want it you can code that yourself aint no way i am doing that. its an unnecessary pain in my ass and id rather walk on hot coal
